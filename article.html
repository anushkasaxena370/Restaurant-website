                            <p>The history of pizza begins in antiquity, as various ancient
                                 cultures produced flatbreads with several toppings. </p>
                            <p>A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia,
                                 a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added.
                                 Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.</p>
                            <p>The word pizza was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy.
                                 Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there.
                                 This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods. </p>
                                 <p>Pizza evolved into a variety of bread and tomato dish often served with cheese.
                                     However, until the late 19th or early 20th century, the dish was sweet, not savory,
                                      and earlier versions that were savory resembled the flatbreads now known as schiacciata.[20]
                                       Pellegrino Artusi's classic early-twentieth-century cookbook, La Scienza in cucina e l'Arte di mangiar 
                                       bene gives three recipes for pizza, 
                                       all of which are sweet. After the feedback of some readers, Artusi added a typed sheet in the 1911 edition ,
                                     bound with the volume, with the recipe of "pizza alla napoletana": mozzarella, tomatoes, anchovies and mushrooms.</p>
